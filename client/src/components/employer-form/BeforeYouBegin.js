        This Expression of Interest does not commit employers to participation in the Health Career Access Program.
        Rather, the form is a first step for employers who want to be considered or are interested in knowing more
        about the HCAP opportunity. After the form has been submitted, operators will be contacted with more
        information and next steps.
