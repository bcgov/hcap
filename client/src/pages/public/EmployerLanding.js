                The Health Career Access Program (HCAP) is a 12-month paid work and training initiative for individuals seeking an entry point to employment in health. New hires will start as a Health Care Support Worker providing non-direct care at a long-term care or assisted living site and receive paid training to become a Health Care Assistant upon successful completion of the program.
