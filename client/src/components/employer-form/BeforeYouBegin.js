            The Health Career Access Program (HCAP) is a 12-month paid work and training initiative for individuals seeking an entry point to employment in health. New hires will start as a Health Care Support Worker providing non-direct care at a long-term care or assisted living site and receive paid training to become a Health Care Assistant upon successful completion of the program.

            A significant number of applicants have already expressed interest in the program through the provincial expression of interest - <Link href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/economic-recovery/work-in-health-care" target="_blank">(https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/economic-recovery/work-in-health-care)</Link>. As HCAP positions are posted externally, a provincial matching process will connect these individuals to employers that are hiring.

          <br />
          <Typography variant="body1">
            HCAP has many benefits for employers who will have the opportunity to access new provincially funded staffing and training resources and play a key role in building capacity in the BC health sector and economy.

            information and next steps.
